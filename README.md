# WebRTC RTC Transport Samples

This repository contains a set of examples that demonstrate how to use the `RtcTransport` API.

## Examples

*   [Same Page](same_page/): This example demonstrates how to use the `RtcTransport` API to send and receive data between two transports on the same page.
*   [Same Page Media](same_page_media/): This example demonstrates how to use the `RtcTransport` API to send and receive video between two transports on the same page.
*   [Cross Page](cross_page/): This example demonstrates how to use the `RtcTransport` API to send and receive data between two different pages.
*   [Cross Page Media](cross_page_media/): This example demonstrates how to use the `RtcTransport` API to send and receive video between two different pages.
*   [Throughput benchmark](throughput_benchmark_rtctransport/): This example demonstrates how to use the `RtcTransport` API to send and receive video between two different pages.
